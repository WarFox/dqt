1. Completeness - data is complete not partially available
2. Accuracy - accurate phone number, birth date etc - needs reference to source of truth
3. Consistency - same dimensions used in multiple instances refer to the same thing
4. Validity - valid phone number, valid date of birth
5. Uniqueness - Ensure no duplicates
6. Integrity - Relationships different and related data is maintained through out the data journey.
   Should be traceble throught the org. Customer address -> Customer Profile
7. Accessibility - is data accessible, searchable etc
8. Timeliness - freshness - is data available when you need it?
9. Relevance - What data is used to support business initiatives?

Data consumers must define whatâ€™s most important and creators must focus on delivering that most important data.
